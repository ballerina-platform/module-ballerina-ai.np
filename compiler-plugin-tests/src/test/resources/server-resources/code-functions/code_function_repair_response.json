    "repairResponse": "Let me analyze the issue and provide a corrected implementation for the `sortEmployeesNPGenerated` function.\n\nThe current implementation has a few issues:\n1. The `sort` function is not available in the provided API documentation\n2. We need to implement our own sorting logic using the available functions\n\nLooking at the API documentation, we can use basic array operations and implement a custom sorting logic. We'll need to:\n1. Create a new array to avoid modifying the input array\n2. Implement bubble sort algorithm to sort based on salary (descending) and name (ascending)\n\nHere's the corrected implementation:\n\n<code filename=\"generated/functions_sortEmployeesNPGenerated.bal\">\n```ballerina\nfunction sortEmployeesNPGenerated(Employee[] employees) returns Employee[] {\n    Employee[] sortedEmployees = employees.clone();\n    int n = sortedEmployees.length();\n    \n    // Bubble sort implementation\n    int i = 0;\n    while i < n - 1 {\n        int j = 0;\n        while j < n - i - 1 {\n            Employee emp1 = sortedEmployees[j];\n            Employee emp2 = sortedEmployees[j + 1];\n            \n            // Compare salary (descending) and name (ascending)\n            if emp1.salary < emp2.salary || \n               (emp1.salary == emp2.salary && emp1.name > emp2.name) {\n                // Swap employees\n                sortedEmployees[j] = emp2;\n                sortedEmployees[j + 1] = emp1;\n            }\n            j += 1;\n        }\n        i += 1;\n    }\n    \n    return sortedEmployees;\n}\n```\n</code>"
