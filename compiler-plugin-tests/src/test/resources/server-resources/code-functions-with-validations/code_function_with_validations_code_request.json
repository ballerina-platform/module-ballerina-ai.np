  "usecase": "An `external` function with the `@code` Ballerina annotation needs to be replaced at\ncompile-time with the code necessary to achieve the requirement specified as the `prompt`\nfield in the annotation.\n\nAs a skilled Ballerina programmer, you have to generate the code to do this for the calculateTotalPrice function.\nThe following prompt defines the requirement:\n\n```\ncalculates the final total price of items by summing valid items\n                    (above minimum price), applying a discount if the subtotal exceeds a threshold,\n                    and adding tax to the discounted amount\n```\n\nYour task is to generate a function named 'calculateTotalPriceNPGenerated' with the code that needs to satisfy this user\nprompt.\n\nThe 'calculateTotalPriceNPGenerated' function should have exactly the same signature as the 'calculateTotalPrice' function.\nUse only the parameters passed to the function and module-level clients that are clients from the ballerina and ballerinax module in the generated code.\nDo not use any configuration variables and module level variables defined in the program.\nRespond with only the generated code, nothing else.\nEnsure that there are NO compile-time errors.\n\nRespond with ONLY THE GENERATED FUNCTION AND ANY IMPORTS REQUIRED BY THE GENERATED FUNCTION.\n",
